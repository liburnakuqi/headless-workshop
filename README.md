# Headless CMS Workshop using Next.js, Sanity and Vercel<!-- omit in toc -->

This is a starter repo used as a part of the Headless CMS Workshop. It walks through the steps needed to build out a statically generated website that uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend, [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) to handle its content and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to deploy to production.

Access the workshop presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L_wW6yrLEmNiVBJEPtweJorlA7yYOjbNUX4Tc9KGA6w/edit?usp=sharing), which will guide you through the steps to build out your own site! You can find the completed example by checking out the `complete-example` branch.

You can start development environment for the frontend app by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000

### Sanity Studio

For this implementation, the Sanity Studio is embedded inside our Next.js app. This means that you just need to start the development environment for the frontend app and navigate to http://localhost:3000/studio.
